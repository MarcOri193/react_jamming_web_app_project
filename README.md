Using React and Spotify API, I've created a tool useful for searching songs in the Spotify library, creating a playlist, and saving it to our Spotify account.

###### To install locally, run the app in development mode and open it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser:

* Clone the repo
* In Terminal, run: _npm install_
* In the project directory, run: _npm start_

###### It requires having a Spotify account for playlists to be saved and a client ID obtainable at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard to add into the src/util/Spotify.js file.
